      <p>Dear Jason,</p>

      <p>
        I’m writing to resign my position as customer service representative,
        effective June 15, 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve recently decided to go back to school, and my program starts in
        early September. I’m tendering my resignation now so that I can be as
        helpful as possible to you during the transition.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve truly enjoyed my time working with you and everyone else on our
        team at LMK. It’s rare to find a customer service role that offers as
        much opportunity to grow and learn and such a positive, inspiring team
        of people to grow and learn with.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering
        furthering my education. Your support has meant so much to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and
        train my replacement.
      </p>

      <p>Thanks, and best wishes,</p>

      <p>Nicole Thomas</p>
